India and the United States have been cementing an ever closer partnership since the start of the millennium. Yet, at least in Asia, India has tried to steer clear of America’s geopolitical contest with China. 

Take, for example, the South China Sea: In 2015, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then US President Barack Obama called upon all parties to resolve disputes amicably under international law. Yet, the following year, when China refused to abide by an international tribunal ruling, India chose not to pass comment. 

In 2016, when America approached India with a proposal for joint patrols, New Delhi demurred again. India finally joined the US, Japan and the Philippines in a naval exercise last year, but it still tried to uphold non-alignment: The Indian warships which participated in that exercise had taken part only a few days earlier in a fleet review with the Chinese themselves. 

India has also made significant compromises on Tibet and Taiwan. In 2018, two months before Mr Modi met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Wuhan, the Indian government asked its senior leaders to avoid events featuring the Dalai Lama. Later that year, the state-owned Air India replaced “Taiwan” with “Chinese Taipei” on its website. 

Yet, for all the tightrope-walking, New Delhi has not much to show for it. Border stand-offs recur every few years all across the Himalayas. China has also continued to oppose India’s membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group – and has stood alone in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) against Indian interests on Pakistan and Kashmir. Worse, while India has compromised on Tibet and Taiwan, China has been far less sensitive to India’s territorial concerns: Beijing legitimised Pakistan’s claims on Kashmir by planning the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor through Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. 

India’s cautiousness towards Beijing is in large part due to the huge disparity in power between the two countries. Unlike against Pakistan, where India holds all the aces, no Indian government gains from a confrontation with China. Yet, in recent years, New Delhi has struggled to keep the Chinese border free from trouble for any considerable stretch of time. 

THE US-INDIA ALIGNMENT 

The root of this conflict is global: India’s non-alignment policy in Asia is not rooted in a non-alignment of interests on the world stage. Owing to similar political and economic structures, India and the US are much better aligned on issues of global governance than India and China – and Beijing knows it. 

In the decades after World War II, Washington built international institutions to coordinate policymaking worldwide. To invest abroad, American businesses and investors needed transparency, rule of law and basic rights. So Washington established bodies that laid down standards for everything, from intellectual property and human rights to trade and finance. These norms created a safe and secure environment for private investors – and treaties were signed to hold countries accountable. 

The two Bretton Woods institutions – the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) – routinely attached strings to their financial assistance, ranging from political considerations like human rights guarantees, to economic ones such as tight government budgets. 

Through the 1990s and the 2000s, China also gained from some of these initiatives. In 2001, it joined the World Trade Organisation to build its export economy – and it has called for stronger trade ties ever since. But unlike in the US, where the private sector is dominant, Chinese economic engagement is much more heavily state-dominated. 

CHINA AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE 

This has significant implications for how Beijing approaches the more political aspects of global governance. In 2015, economist David Dollar pointed out that, unlike American investment, Chinese investment seeks out countries that have basic political stability, even if transparency and rule of law are weak – as in Cambodia, Venezuela and Zambia. This is owing to the state-run nature of Chinese investment: So long as there is a powerful and stable government in place, Beijing will sign a government-togovernment deal to cover its projects, regardless of how that country’s institutions and laws treat other private firms. But when an American firm finds its interests threatened, it would need to rely on the local courts and rule of law. 

China has long railed against what it sees as “external interference” by international institutions. In 2015, China launched the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to lend with few strings attached. The AIIB’s Articles of Agreement say that the bank “shall not interfere in the political affairs of any member, nor shall they be influenced in their decisions by the political character of the member concerned”. 

In the years ahead, China will continue striving to make global governance less encumbered by the political norms championed by the US, putting it on a warpath with Washington. 

This is where India could be a potential problem. Like America, India’s economy is also dominated by the private sector – and it has benefited from the same old norms. In 1991, India’s economy came back from the brink of collapse, thanks to IMF support. With economic reform in the years that followed, India’s private sector started venturing out like America’s, riding on the same network of international norms. In March last year, Indian companies said that their outward investment had increased by 18 per cent compared with the previous year. And despite trade protectionism in recent times, economic reform remains an important election plank. 

India co-founded the AIIB with China in 2015, but this was not due to a disagreement over the norms of the World Bank or the IMF. Instead, it was to protest against India’s limited voting rights. Elsewhere, India has shown itself closer to the US than to China: Along with the US, India has long been a regular and generous contributor to the United Nations Democracy Fund, which helps build credible democratic institutions in post-conflict states. India has also invested heavily in Afghan democracy, including support for the media sector and electoral process.

Washington knows that its own interests would be served by India’s presence in global councils – and it has repeatedly expressed that conviction. America has long been among the most vocal supporters for a permanent Indian seat in the UNSC. By contrast, China has been hesitant to support India’s bid consistently, especially in recent years. 

Given the shared values and present trajectory, New Delhi is almost certain to align with Washington on global governance. And China is pre-empting this by seeking to contain India’s own rise as a global power. 

China’s quibbles with India are more than mere border disputes; for the past few years, China has tried to counterbalance Indian influence in South Asia – particularly through engagement with Nepal and Pakistan. 

In the Himalayas, Beijing does not wish to merely occupy icy wetlands, which may anyway need to be vacated before the snowy winter. China’s objective, instead, is to contain India’s global rise by tying up New Delhi’s strategic resources in South Asia. 

On its part, India needs to deter Chinese aggression by balancing against Chinese interests globally. In this regard, sitting out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership would be a missed opportunity. On issues of global governance, New Delhi should seek to establish transparent dialogue with Beijing to find common ground. India’s strategic community has not yet seriously explored what norms New Delhi should champion, and China and India have not yet therefore openly clashed over these issues. But as always, Beijing is planning long term.
