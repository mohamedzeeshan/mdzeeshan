When Joe Biden won the US presidential election, many Asian observers were worried about how he would react to China’s rise. Now, analysts are already in a flutter – over words and semantics, if nothing else.

Early in the transition period, some observers were worried that Biden seemed more invested in tackling the Middle East than China. In a much-analysed article for The Atlantic, Biden wrote about why he picked Lloyd Austin as his defence secretary.

As analyst Blake Herzinger pointed out, that piece had “multiple mentions of his Middle East experience” but no mention of China. Biden’s selection of Jake Sullivan as national security adviser also seemed to have one eye on Iran and an effort to prioritise the nuclear deal.

Meanwhile, Biden also appears to be softening some of the language used by the Trump administration that proved controversial in Beijing. The most notable is the term “Indo-Pacific”, which had begun to replace “Asia-Pacific” in American diplomatic talk. The idea was to convey that US foreign policy should see the Indian Ocean, South China Sea and Pacific Ocean as one contiguous strategic region of Chinese influence.

The Trump administration had seen its expansive definition of the Indo-Pacific as a way to include India in its efforts to counter Chinese influence. As analyst Jeff Smith recently wrote, though, Biden has started reverting back to Asia-Pacific in his public statements.

In remarks that followed his piece in The Atlantic, for instance, Biden talked about “rebuilding and modernising our alliances, from the Asia-Pacific to Europe and around the world”. In its 2020 platform, the Democratic Party also adopted the same term.

All this might not be entirely innocuous. China has long considered Washington’s transition to the Indo-Pacific concept as an effort to counter its growing influence in South Asia and the Indian Ocean, including its Belt and Road Initiative. Beijing has urged governments to drop the term and often explicitly asked India to stay away from US-led efforts such as the Quad. It expressed cautious displeasure when New Delhi decided to include Australia in the Malabar naval exercises.

For his part, Biden has strong incentives to re-engage with China on multiple issues that seem more urgent to his administration: climate change, nuclear proliferation in Iran, trade and post-pandemic recovery. To the president-elect, a shift away from the Indo-Pacific to the Asia-Pacific might seem like a small price to pay in return.

Such a shift should make Delhi extremely nervous. India’s relationship with China plunged to unprecedented depths in 2020, and Delhi is now staring at a two-front conflict with a China-Pakistan alliance.

The heightened threat along both sides of its Himalayan border has also put considerable strain on India’s military capabilities. Some experts reckon that, to prepare for these threats, the Indian Air Force requires twice as many squadrons as it currently has.

With Covid-19 strangling the Indian economy, however, this is far from practical. Instead, to successfully build deterrence, India needs to find allies. If Delhi can build a coalition with powers in East and Southeast Asia, it can put pressure on China on the maritime front in those regions, especially when it faces aggression along the Himalayas.

The problem for Delhi is that the US and its allies are not naturally invested in Chinese aggression in South Asia or the Himalayas. The US has historically been involved through various treaties and alliances in East Asia and the South China Sea. Multiple countries also have deeply entrenched trade interests in those regions.

By contrast, the Himalayas have always remained far removed from these theatres, thereby leaving India to fight China alone in the mountains. Delhi’s key strategic challenge in recent times, therefore, has been to associate peace in the Himalayas with peace in the Asia-Pacific.

Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy and its key implements – especially the Quad – promised to move things precisely in that direction. That is why, after years of dithering about the Quad, India has taken to it much more openly in recent times.

Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has also stoutly defended the Indo-Pacific concept. In February, he said, “[We] cannot deal with the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean as two separate arenas.” Later in the year, when Russia criticised Indo-Pacific strategies, Jaishankar replied, “Only a person in denial of globalisation will actually contest Indo-Pacific.”

India’s challenge in the new year will be to keep Biden committed to the Indo-Pacific. That means Delhi will have to make itself more relevant to the interests of the US and its allies in East and Southeast Asia. Delhi should consider a more proactive policy of siding with Washington in the South China Sea and vocally oppose Chinese militarisation in that region.

India also needs to rethink its trade policy in the Indo-Pacific. Delhi missed an opportunity to take part in regional economic integration by sitting out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. It should at least explore a possible alternative.

India needs Biden to stay on course with America’s Indo-Pacific strategy, but that can only be possible if Delhi makes itself relevant to Biden’s own concerns.
