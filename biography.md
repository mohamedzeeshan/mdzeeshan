Like many obedient Indians of his age, Mohamed Zeeshan - also called "Zee" by his friends and colleagues - entered engineering school at the age of 17, only to abandon it to follow an altogether different passion. He took to blogging in just his second year of undergraduate studies, hoping to use the internet age to broadcast his views, thoughts and opinions on a motley of issues, ranging from politics to the economy, and even the world of cricket.

Soon, that disparate range narrowed down to focused commentary and analysis of international politics and governance. While still diverse in nature, Zeeshan's writings have largely focused on India's role in the world, and its quest to evolve from a developing post-colonial economy to a global leader in a multipolar era. Zeeshan's fresh insights and original takes on some of the most urgent questions of our time attracted the attention of policymakers and thinkers from around the world.

By the time he entered his final year at engineering school, Zeeshan had begun writing regular columns on foreign policy and international affairs for The Diplomat, India Today and other reputed publications based in India and elsewhere. He was invited to host a personal blog on HuffPost India, where he writes occasionally on matters of Indian and international governance. During the course of his work as a political analyst and commentator, Zeeshan has given media interviews to BBC Radio, NDTV 24x7 and HuffPost Live, dealing with sundry issues such as Venezuela's future post Hugo Chavez and India's role in concluding the Paris climate agreement.

All of this led to Zeeshan's eventual transition into the policy academia - and to Columbia University, where he currently studies international affairs and serves as a Teaching Assistant on Economic Analysis. In line with his experience in and around the mainstream media, Zeeshan was appointed to serve on the Editorial Board of the prestigious Columbia Journal of International Affairs as its Digital and Online Director.

He also served briefly as a Policy Adviser to the Permanent Mission of India at the United Nations in 2017. During his time at the Permanent Mission, Zeeshan aided in strategizing India's successful campaign for a seat in the International Court of Justice and also conducted research on sensitive policy issues surrounding India's quest for a seat in the United Nations Security Council. In recent times, Zeeshan has been working on a book dealing with India's foreign policy in a world full of threats and opportunities for New Delhi.

Aside from his keen interests in international diplomacy and governance, Zeeshan is also an avid cricket fan and vociferous reader. He was also a decorated debater through his days in high school and university, and an active member of university debate clubs. Though he rarely speaks of it today, his love for writing was sparked by Enid Blyton, whom he still regards his most favourite author - not too far ahead, perhaps, of Agatha Christie. He hopes to pen a detective novel of his own someday, inspired by the adventures of Hercule Poirot.
